Abstract
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The availability of rapid prototyping enhances a designerâ€™s creativity and
 speed, enabling quicker development of new products.
 However, because this process relies heavily on computer-aided design (CAD)
 models it can often be time costly and inefficient when a component is
 needed urgently in the field.
 This paper proposes a method to seamlessly integrate the digitization of
 existing objects with the rapid prototyping process.
 Our technique makes use of multiple structured-light techniques in conjunction
 with photogrammetry to build a more efficient means of product development.
 This combination of methods allows our developed application to rapidly
 scan an entire object using inexpensive hardware.
 Single views obtained by projecting binary and sinusoidal patterns are
 combined using photogrammetry feature tracking to create a computer model
 of the subject.

\begin_layout Standard
We present also the results of the application of these concepts, as applied
 to several familiar objects--these objects have been scanned, modified,
 and sent to a rapid prototyping machine to demonstrate the power of this
 tool.
 This technique is useful in a wide range of engineering applications, both
 in the field and in the lab.
 Future projects may improve the accuracy of the scans through better calibratio
n and meshing, and test the accuracy of the digitized models more thoroughly.
