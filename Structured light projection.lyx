Microsoft Kinect
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Kinect works based on a fixed pseudorandom array of dots projected on
 an infrared wavelength.
 The dots are formed by an array of small microlenses, each with a slightly
 different focal length.
 The included infrared camera picks up the projection of these dots on their
 environment.
 Groups of dots are then compared against an image taken on a reference
 plane.
 Due to the pseudorandom nature of the dot array, each group is unique enough
 to allow identification of a particular dot based on the relative positions
 of neighboring dots.
 Furthermore, due to the different focal lengths of the microlenses, the
 pattern itself will vary based on the distance between the camera and the
 object

\begin_layout Standard
Microsoft has kept its specific algorithms for calculating the depth proprietary.
 However, the open-source community has had some success in reverse-engineering
 the Kinect.
 In its operating range between 0.8 and 3.5 meters, the Kinect can resolve
 depth with about 10 mm accuracy along the optical axis, and position to
 about 3 mm perpendicular to the optical axis

Evaluation of line-scanner accuracy

\begin_layout Standard
One of the simplest setups to conceive and operate is a line-scanning system.
 Such a system projects a line, usually a laser beam, onto an object, and
 then uses triangulation to extract the three-dimensional data from the
 contour.

 We know that the projector will project a line on any flat surface.
 Extending this concept, we can imagine a

 We can also imagine the ray of reflected light traveling from the contour

 point in the image, and the relative location and angle of the projector
 and camera, we can now compute the absolute 3D position data for the given

 contouring is a technique that uses interference to beautiful consequence--when
 light is passed through a grating, reflected off an object, and collected
 at a different point than where it was emitted, the entire object will
 appear to be wrapped in a contour map showing levels of equal displacement
 from the grating.
 Figure

 The grating lines themselves are very small and can only be seen upon close
 inspection of the image.

More importantly, assuming the camera and the light source are in the same
 plane perpendicular to the fringe direction, the image shows bright contours
 located at points equidistant from the grating.
 According to

, the

This may be difficult to picture.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 demonstrates how two sets of rays through a grating produce bright equidistance
 contours.
 The circle at top-left represents a light source, and the circle at top-right
 a camera.
 In order for the camera to see a bright pixel, the following conditions
 have to take place:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The camera's view of the object at that pixel must not be impeded by the
 grating.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The object must also be lit at that location by light coming through the
 grating.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using these two assumptions, we can now sketch lines through the points
 of maximum transmittance on the grating.
 Wherever these lines intersect on the object, the camera will see a bright
 spot.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One immediate advantage of such a simple equation is that the depths may
 be computed in near-real time.
 If the camera and light source are fixed to a rigid frame, then 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{ls_{0}}{d}$
\end_inset

 will be a constant.
 Assuming that the contour-finding algorithm is fast, the fact that the
 algorithm yields a fixed distance for each 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 will mean a computer could conceivably render a point cloud as the data
 comes in.

\begin_layout Standard
The major disadvantage of the moir

\begin_inset Formula $R_{u}$

 has no uncertainty --- it is an integer count of the physical pixels installed

 For a given scanning setup, it is a constant.
 Therefore, all of the uncertainty arises from the field-of-view constant

 and the uncertainty in the precise position of the pixel.
 The ideal equations assume that the ray of light passes directly through
 the center of the pixel, but this is not always the case.

 of that pixel's collector, but it is also possible that the light arrived
 near the edge or near the corner.

 images, which allows for the most accurate calculation of applied phase.
 For convenience we will define 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{i}\equiv\alpha\left(i-1\right)$

\begin_layout Standard
The uncertainty in the wrapped phase calculation is given as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(\frac{\sigma_{\phi}}{\phi}\right)^{2}=\left[\frac{\sum\sigma_{I_{i}}\sin\alpha_{i}}{\sum I_{i}\sin\alpha_{i}}+\frac{\sum\sigma_{I_{i}}\cos\alpha_{i}}{\sum I_{i}\cos\alpha_{i}}+1\right]^{-2}
\]

\end_inset

in which each summation is taken from 
\begin_inset Formula $i=1\rightarrow m$
\end_inset

Uncertainty in an intensity level due to bit depth is inversely exponentially
 proportional to the bit depth

\begin_inset Formula 
\[

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Sources of large error in phase calculations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Certain factors can create unnecessary and uncontrolled error in phase calculati
ons.
 The most significant such factor is an overexposed image.
 By maxing out the camera's ability to detect light over part of the fringe-shif
ting process, a bright surface can tend to generate certain phases dictated
 only by induced phase shift and not at all by the surface's location.
 Furthermore, by overexposing the camera even without fringes projected,
 bright light can completely remove all meaningful information from a projected
 view.

\begin_layout Standard
It is a simple matter to project a single fringe upon an object and triangulate.
