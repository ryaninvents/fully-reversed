  abstract = {We present a survey of the most significant techniques, used in the
	last few years, concerning the coded structured light methods employed
	to get 3D information. In fact, depth perception is one of the most
	important subjects in computer vision. Stereovision is an attractive
	and widely used method, but, it is rather limited to make 3D surface
	maps, due to the correspondence problem. The correspondence problem
	can be improved using a method based on structured light concept,
	projecting a given pattern on the measuring surfaces. However, some
	relations between the projected pattern and the reflected one must
	be solved. This relationship can be directly found codifying the
	projected light, so that, each imaged region of the projected pattern
	carries the needed information to solve the correspondence problem.

  abstract = {Changes in measured image irradiance have many physical causes and
	are the primary cue for several visual processes, such as edge detection
	and shape from shading. Using physical models for charged-coupled

	the variation in digitized pixel values that is due to sensor noise
	and scene variation. This analysis forms the basis of algorithms
	for camera characterization and calibration and for scene description.
	Specifically, algorithms are developed for estimating the parameters
	of camera noise and for calibrating a camera to remove the effects
	of fixed pattern nonuniformity and spatial variation in dark current.
	While these techniques have many potential uses, we describe in particular
	how they can be used to estimate a measure of scene variation. This
	measure is independent of image irradiance and can be used to identify
	a surface from a single sensor band over a range of situations. Experimental
	results confirm that the models presented in this paper are useful
	for modeling the different sources of variation in real images obtained

  title = {Scene reconstruction and visualization from internet photo collections},
  school = {University of Washington},
  year = {2008},
  abstract = {The Internet is becoming an unprecedented source of visual information,
	with billions of images instantly accessible through image search
	engines such as Google Images and Flickr. These include thousands
	of photographs of virtually every famous place, taken from a multitude
	of viewpoints, at many different times of day, and under a variety
	of weather conditions. This thesis addresses the problem of leveraging
	such photos to create new 3D interfaces for virtually exploring our
	world.
	
	
	One key challenge is that recreating 3D scenes from photo collections
	requires knowing where each photo was taken. This thesis introduces
	new computer vision techniques that robustly recover such information
	from photo collections without requiring GPS or other instrumentation.
	These methods are the first to be demonstrated on Internet imagery,
	and show that 3D reconstruction techniques can be successfully applied
	to this rich, largely untapped resource. For this problem scale is
	a particular concern, as Internet collections can be extremely large.
	I introduce an efficient reconstruction algorithm that selects a
	small skeletal set of images as a preprocess. This approach can reduce
	reconstruction time by an order of magnitude with little or no loss
	in completeness or accuracy.
	
	
	A second challenge is to build interfaces that take these reconstructions
	and provide effective scene visualizations. Towards this end, I describe
	two new 3D user interfaces. Photo Tourism is a 3D photo browser with
	new geometric controls for moving between photos. These include zooming
	in to find details, zooming out for more context, and selecting an
	image region to find photos of an object. The second interface, Pathfinder,
	takes advantage of the fact that people tend to take photos of interesting
	views and along interesting paths. Pathfinder creates navigation
	controls tailored to each location by analyzing the distribution
	of photos to discover such characteristic views and paths. These
	controls make it easy to find and explore the important parts of
	each scene.
	
	
	Together these techniques enable the automatic creation of 3D experiences
	for famous sites. A user simply enters relevant keywords and the
	system automatically downloads images, reconstructs the site, derives
	navigation controls, and provides an immersive interface.},

	bias electrons, and thermoelectrons and the Gaussian component representing
	readout noise. Two methods are examined for compensating for readout
	noise. One method relies on approximating the Gaussian readout noise
	by a Poisson noise and then using a modified Richardson--Lucy algorithm
	to effect the compensation. This method has been used for restoring
	images acquired with CCD's in the original Wide-Field/Planetary Camera
	aboard the Hubble Space Telescope. The second method directly uses
	the expectation-maximization algorithm derived for the Poisson--Gaussian
	mixture data. This requires the determination of the conditional-mean
	estimate of the Poisson component of the mixture, which is accomplished
	by the evaluation of a nonlinear function of the data. The second
	method requires more computation than he first but is more accurate
	mathematically and yields modest improvements in the quality of the
	restorations, particularly for fainter objects. As a specific example,
	we compare the two methods in restorations of images representative
	of those acquired with that camera; they contain excess blurring
	that is due to spherical aberration and a rms readout noise level
	of 13 electrons.},

  title = {Development of a high-speed, robust system for full field-of-view
	{3D} shape measurements},
  school = {Worcester Polytechnic Institute},
  year = {2011},
  month = {August},
  abstract = {3D shape measurements are critical in a range of fields, from manufacturing
	for quality measurements to art conservation for the everlasting
	archival of ancient sculptures. The most
	
	important factor is to gather quantitative 3D information from measurement
	devices. Currently, there are limitations of existing systems. Many
	of the techniques are contact methods, proving to be time consuming
	and invasive to materials. While non-contact methods provide opportunities,
	many of the current systems are limited in versatility.
	
	
	This project focuses on the development of a fringe projection based
	system for 3D shape measurements. The critical advantage of the fringe
	projection optical technique is the ability to provide full field-of-view
	(FOV) information on the order from several square millimeters to
	several square meters. In the past, limitations in speed and difficulties
	achieving sinusoidal projection patterns have restricted the development
	of this particular type of system and limited its potential applications.
	For this reason, direct coding techniques have been incorporated
	to the developed system that modulate the intensity of each pixel
	to form a sinusoidal pattern using a 624 nm wavelength MEMS based
	spatial light modulator. Recovered phase data containing shape information
	is obtained using varying algorithms that range from a single image
	FFT analysis to a sixteen image, phase stepping algorithm.
	
	
	Reconstruction of 3D information is achievable through several image
	unwrapping techniques. The first is a spatial unwrapping technique
	for high speed applications. Additionally, the system uses an optimized
	Temporal Phase Unwrapping (TPU) algorithm that utilizes varying fringe
	frequencies ranging from 4 to 512 pixels per fringe to recover shape
	information in the time domain. This algorithm was chosen based on
	its robustness and accuracy for high resolution applications [Burke
	et al., 2002]. Also, unwrapping errors are minimized by approximately
	90% as the number of images used is increased from the minimum to
	maximum fringe density.
	
	
	Contrary to other systems, the 3D shape measurement system developed
	in the CHSLT laboratories has unprecedented versatility to accommodate
	a variety of applications with the z-depth resolution of up to 25.4
	μm (0.001 inches) and speeds close to 200 frames per second. Hardware
	systems are integrated into user-friendly software that has been
	customized for fringe projection. The system has been tested in two
	extreme environments. The first is for quantification of cracks and
	potholes in the surface of roads under dynamic conditions. The second
	application was digitization of an art sculpture under static conditions.
	The system shows promising results and the potential for high quality
	images via algorithm optimization. Most importantly, there is potential
	to present real time 3D information at video speeds.},
